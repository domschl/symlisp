## todos

- [x] Environment structure and basic operations (sl_env_create, sl_env_define, sl_env_lookup).
- [x] Basic eval handling self-evaluating types and symbol lookup.
- [x] Implement quote special form in eval.
- [x] Implement a few simple builtins (car, cdr, cons) and the apply logic for builtins.
- [x] Populate the global environment with these builtins. Test simple calls like (car (quote (1 2))).
- [x] Add math for +, -, *, /
- [x] Implement lambda special form (creating closures) and apply logic for closures. (Basic TCO included)
- [x] Implement define special form. Test defining and calling simple functions.
- [x] Implement if special form.
- [x] Implement set! special form.
- [x] Add API functions for environment get/set/define by C string name.
- [x] Remove reliance on fixed allocations for buffers
- [x] Implement `begin` special form (for multi-expression bodies in lambda/define).
- [x] Implement basic I/O: `display`, `newline`.
- [x] Implement file I/O: `load` function.
- [x] Implement library loading mechanism (e.g., `load-library` or auto-load from dir).
- [x] Implement more builtins: list, eq?, equal?
- [x] Implement more builtins: remainder, modulo // <<< ADDED
- [x] let and named let
- [x] Test framwork
- [x] CI with valgrind
- [x] cond
- [ ] Boolean ops: or, and, not
- [ ] List functions: length, append, reverse
- [ ] Predicate tester functions
- [ ] String functions
- [ ] Implement symbol interning in sl_make_symbol so that only one symbol object exists per unique name. Then you can revert the environment functions sl_env_define/lookup/set
- [ ] Refine lambda/define syntax validation (variadics?), variable arity support (lambda)
- [ ] map
- [ ] Refine parameter binding error handling (GC).
- [ ] Gradually add more builtins.
- [ ] Macros: define-syntax, let-syntax
- [x] Refine error handling and GC integration for environments. (Initial error object mechanism added)
- [ ] Check against r7rs
- [ ] Standard library
- [ ] Symbolics libs
- [ ] Kernel
- [ ] MCP/agnt
